# Sorting-Visualizer
A Sorting Visualizer application using pygame

The Sorting Visualizer consists of 6 most popular sorting algorithms namely
Naive Sorting Algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort

Advanced Sorting Algorithms:
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Radix Sort

The main motive of the sorting visualizer application is to show how different sorting algorithms sorts (in this case numbers represented as rectangle) in real-time.
